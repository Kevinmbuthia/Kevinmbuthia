 I'm passionate about building efficient teams and systems. I've done my best to positively influence different tech communities across Africa. My career started off with Mathematics and SQL and I have been gradually moving up the stack. I'm now obsessed with Functional programming, stochastic differential equations, and Micro Services Architecture. I love teaching developers and have spoken at various meetups and conferences focused on web development and system Architecture. In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, bicycle riding, drinking scotch, and reading crime thriller novels. I currently live in Nakuru, Kenya.
